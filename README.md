## :bulb: My process
### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Axios
- Tailwind CSS
- React

### Key takeaways
- Having an idea, wireframe and reference is important to building the app.
- Plan the features out on trello board, from broad strokes to fine tuning minor details.
- Understanding tailwind CSS takes time.
- Feedback and sharing ideas is helpful for improving on the project.
- Learnt how to create a function to listen if the bottom of the screen has been reached. 
- Learnt how to use React Routers.
- Learnt how to convert a string into (hero)icons.
### Personal challenges
- Building the table, but understood it after dt explained.
- HTML structure is important, because I started off with tailwind Navbar and wanted to keep that in every page, so I kept some of the div that came with the Hero layout but it become confusing keeping track what HTML elements are in which box.
## :triumph: Future deployment
- Add localstorage to allow users to store id of favourite teams, and fetch the team stats.
- Add links to cards, hover effect and right arrow on bottom right corner.
- Add more stats to the team stats page.
- Add filters (by season, matchweek) to standings page to change the season.
- Show live matches on upcoming fixtures, while still only listing 15 on each side.
- Add colours to teams on the standings page to highlight the top four and the last few at risk of relegation.
- Add upper green arrow and downwards red arrow for teams that moved on the standings table.
- Add a dropdown to the teams on the standings table to show the last result, next game's timing and previous performance in a chart.
Add modal to match list page to view the current standings, last 2 results in previous meeting, and each teams' 5 previous results. of the two teams.
